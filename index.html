<h1>Paul Crellin <span>web developer &amp; designer</span></h1>

<hr />

<h3>Hello.</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Paul Crellin, a web developer / designer living on the Wirral in North West England. Below you'll find a few details about me and my work. Please <a href="mailto:website@crellbar.com">get in touch</a> if you would like to discuss a possible project or want to chat.</p>


<h3>About Paul.</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working as a developer on a range of interesting projects for an international agency. I love every aspect of design and development from the intial planning of the information architecture (i.e. which pages will go where and how we break a site up in to sections) all the way through design, coding and user experience work. The sites I build are maintainable so even post launch when little tweaks are needed it&rsquo;s a great experience.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not working you&rsquo;ll find me doing a little travel, a little photography, plenty of reading and relaxing with good company.</p>


<h3>Samples.</h3>
<p>A developer / designer should always stand by their work, here&rsquo;s some of mine; I hope you enjoy it as much as I do:</p>

        <h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.arsenal.com">Arsenal FC</a></h4>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve worked as a developer on the Arsenal football club site since it was re-launched in 2008. This comprehensive site is CMS driven and integrates with a range of other services.</p>
        <p>This site has a range of templates available through the CMS allowing unique pages and sections of the site to be created by the journalists and administrators using the system.</p>
        <p>Other features include match reports, embedded videos, fixture calendar (with ICal feeds), wallpapers &amp; screensavers, facebook integration and player details management.</p>
        <p>Development has also been completed for the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.arsenal.com/junior-gunners/">Junior Gunners</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.arsenal.com/platinum/">Platinum</a> micro-sites.</p>
        <p>My work on this site has been on behalf of an agency in Liverpool.</p>

        <h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://wefeedback.org/">United Nations World Food Programme</a></h4>
        <p>In 2012 I was given the opportunity to work on a project for the United Nations. The system I helped build was an API (kind of like a website that computers, rather than humans, read) that allowed other software to make donations to the World Food Programme, the food distribution arm of the UN.</p>
        <p>This system drives websites such as the WFP's wefeedback site pictured above. It can also be used by any other computer system such as supermarket checkouts, internet TVs, restaurant websites/checkouts etc. This allows the WFP to acquire a large number of partners to help raise funds for numerous good causes.</p>
        <p>The application is an automatically scalable system so that should a crisis occur somewhere around the world and millions of people rush to donate online the service will increase the amount of servers / bandwidth available to handle all of the donations.</p>
        <p>My work on this system has been on behalf of an international agency in Liverpool.</p>

        <h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://player.arsenal.com">Arsenal Player</a></h4>
        <p>After successful completion and continuous development of the main arsenal website I was lucky enough to be given the chance to work on Arsenal Player. This site allows users to play videos and audio streams of live matches, interviews, highlights and more.</p>
        <p>A bespoke content management system was developed to allow the admin team to manage where on the site videos appear and schedule when they should be made available.</p>
        <p>This site also integrates with the main arsenal.com website advertising the paid for service and showing free content teasers.</p>

        <h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sykescottages.co.uk">Sykes Cottages</a></h4>
        <p>The Sykes Cottages site allows people to find a cottage, using a range of search options, and to book and pay online.</p>
        <p>The site uses a 'live' AJAX search to bring in results and has two-way integration with the search map on which property results are plotted and updated as users filter down to more specific areas. The map itself is interactive and updates the search results when the user clicks on it.</p>
        <p>The CMS for this site contains a system for creating 'auto-search' landing pages to help improve search engine optimisation, bring more visitors to the site.</p>
        <p>The same system also drives Sykes other brand <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hogansirishcottages.com/">Hogans Irish Cottages</a>, and the part-translated <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sykesurlaub.de/">German version of the Sykes site</a>.</p>

        <p>As part of my role as developer in a large Liverpool based web agency I created the Your Everton social network.</p>
        <p>This social network allows fans of the club to interact with each other, post their photos of the game, comment on articles, view friends' comments, write match resports with photos and search other users of the network.</p>
        <p>The social network now has over 13,000 users.</p>

        <p>This CMS driven site for West Mercia Police, an advancement on standard page based systems, allows for version controlled pages. All content on the page and related media can be reverted to a previous version of saved as a draft for future publication.</p>
        <p>Integrating with data feeds from the force, it includes details of local policing teams and allows you to find your local policing team by entering your postcode.</p>
        <p>News added via the CMS is related to operational areas or campaigns allowing users of the site to find content more easily.</p>

        <p>I inherited a job maintaining an existing system that URS use for managing many thousands of projects and helped to keep it running while also adding new features.</p>
        <p>The system used a mish-mash of technologies and required considered planning to keep it running.</p>

        <h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thebusinessdesk.com">TheBusinessDesk.com</a></h4>
        <p>The Business Desk began reporting news in Yorkshire and expanded quickly to the North West and West Midlands. The CMS driven site that was developed for TBD had to grow just a quickly and now sends over 1 million emails per month which lead to many thousands of unique impressions on the site.</p>
        <p>News on this, free to register, site is associated to a range of channels across the three regions to help users find exactly the content they are looking for.</p>

        <p>In addition, the CMS allows easy in-depth management of the competitions and offers that appear on the site along with contacts for such promotions. The system also allows winners to be picked and emailed through the CMS.</p>
        <p>Post-launch we added functionality for "photo competitions" such as <a rel="nofollow" href="http://myliverpoolecho.co.uk/face-of-the-echo">face of the echo</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mydailypost.co.uk/face-of-the-future/">face of the future</a>, each uses a custom design and collects custom details but can be added in to the site easily.</p>

        <p>Hallmark Jewellers were looking to rebrand the company; With some ideas about the imagery, feeling and brand they wanted they asked me to help them plan, design and build a website.</p>
        <p>The new site matches the branding and due to being search engine optimised has brought more visitors to the site. The client are delighted with what has been delivered, which they say makes a marked difference to their experience with previous web developers / designers (including large agencies).</p>
        <p>We are continuing development of this site for the foreseeable future adding features and content to make it even more useful for customers and profitable for Hallmark.</p>

        <p>This small static site for a local dance and fitness instructor was designed to give an energetic vibe and promote the different classes and services that Cathy provides.</p>
        <p>Cathy was fortunate enough to have someone film one of her classes, a clip of which makes it in to the site.</p>
        <p>The site makes use of one primary call to action with two additional promotional elements on each page: a graphical floating footer and a right hand panel showing the latest classes.</p>

<h4>Other projects</h4>
<p><strong>Desktop software:</strong> Several years back I completed a bespoke piece of desktop software for tracking entries and memberships of a private members club in Liverpool city centre. The system utilised a range of external hardware such as web cams and printers.</p>
<p><strong>BBC Reboot:</strong> Even though I only found about (and rushed an entry to) the competition the day before it closed I was a winner of the BBC Reboot competition to reinvent the BBC homepage back in 2006 (my student days). My design was in a rough form but the ideas developed and descriptions of it were creative enough for the judges to consider it one of the winners.</p>
